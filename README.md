# LLM-Vision-Datasets

In the era of large language models (LLMs), this repository is dedicated to collecting datasets, particularly focusing on image and video data for generative AI (such as diffusion models) and image-text paired data for multimodal models. We hope that the datasets shared by the community can help everyone better learn and train new AI models. By collaborating and sharing resources, we can accelerate the progress towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Let's work together to create a comprehensive collection of datasets that will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts alike, ultimately paving the way for the realization of AGI.

## How to Add a New Dataset

To contribute a new dataset to this repository, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Add your dataset to the appropriate section in the README file, following the format:

```
| Name  | Describe  | URL     |
|-|-|-|
|DatasetsName | DatasetsDescribe | DatasetsURL |
```

For example:
```
| Name  | Describe  | URL     |
|-|-|-|
| LAION | Released LAION-400M, LAION-5B, and other ultra-large image-text datasets, as well as various types of CLIP data. | https://laion.ai/projects/  https://huggingface.co/laion |
```
If your dataset doesn't fit into any of the existing categories, create a new section for it in the README file.

4. Commit and push, Create a pull request.

By following these steps, you can help expand the collection of datasets available in this repository and contribute to the advancement of generative AI and multimodal visual AI research.

Contributions of more datasets related to generative AI and multimodal visual AI are welcome! If you have any suggestions or comments, please feel free to open an issue.
